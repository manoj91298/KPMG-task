# KPMG-task
**Challenge #1** - 3-Tier Environment Setup on Cloud Platform
Description: In this challenge, the task is to set up a 3-tier environment on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP). A 3-tier environment typically consists of a web server, an application server, and a database server. The candidate is asked to use a cloud infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool, such as AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, or Google Cloud Deployment Manager, to define and create the required cloud resources for the 3-tier setup. The focus of this challenge is on the candidate's approach, style, and reproducibility in using the chosen IaC tool to create the environment.

**Challenge #2** - Instance Metadata Query and JSON Output
Description: The challenge requires writing code to query the metadata of an instance within AWS, Azure, or GCP and providing the output in JSON format. The candidate can choose any programming language and implementation of their choice. The code should be able to fetch instance metadata programmatically, such as the instance ID, region, IP address, and other instance attributes. Bonus points are given if the code allows for the retrieval of specific data keys from the instance metadata.

**Challenge #3** - Function to Retrieve Value from Nested Object
Description: In this challenge, the candidate is asked to implement a function that takes a nested object and a key as input and returns the corresponding value from the nested object. The key is provided as a dot-separated path to traverse the nested object. For example, given the input `{"a": {"b": {"c": "d"}}}` and the key `a/b/c`, the function should return the value `"d"`. The function should work for arbitrary levels of nesting. The candidate can choose any programming language and implementation to solve this challenge and is encouraged to include test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the function.
